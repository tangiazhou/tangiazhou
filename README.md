Hi! My name is Tangia and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto! I am interested in communications and signal processing and hope to continue into this field in the future. I'm currently on my PEY (Professional Experience Year) at AMD, working in High-Speed Signal and Power Integrity. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in fine-art photography. Recently, I have been dabbling with various types of compact cameras, which I have been enjoying a lot. Currently, I am working on updating a previous photo essay I created revolving around educational gloom.
