Hi! My name is Tangia and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto! I am interested in communications and signal processing and hope to continue into this field in the future. I'm currently on my PEY (Professional Experience Year) at AMD, working in High-Speed Signal and Power Integrity. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in photography and the culinary arts. I typically shoot on a DSLR, but recently I've been dabbling with point-and-shoots, which I have been really enjoying ;) Additionally, I have always loved the field of Hospitality and Tourism and hope to complete a certificate in culinary arts in the near future.
