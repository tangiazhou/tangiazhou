Hi! My name is Tangia and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto! I am interested in communications and signal processing and hope to continue into this field in the future. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in photography and the culinary arts. I typically shoot on a DSLR, but recently I've been dabbling with point-and-shoots, which I have been really enjoying ;).
