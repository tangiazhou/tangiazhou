Hi! My name is Tangia and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto! I am interested in communications and signal processing and hope to continue into this field in the future. I'm currently on my PEY (Professional Experience Year) at AMD, working in High-Speed Signal and Power Integrity. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in photography and the culinary arts. Recently, I've been dabbling with various types of compact cameras, which I have been enjoying a lot. In my spare time, I also like to try new cooking and baking recipes. In the future, I hope to pursue a certificate in either fine art photography or the culinary arts.
