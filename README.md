Hi! My name is Tangia and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto! I am interested in communications and signal processing and hope to continue into this field in the future. I'm currently on my PEY (Professional Experience Year) at AMD, working in High-Speed Signal and Power Integrity. 

Apart from academics, I enjoy photography and exploring the outdoors. Recently, I've been dabbling with different types of compact cameras, which I have been enjoying a lot. Right now with my point-and-shoot, I've been working on a photojournal capturing my life in the summer. On the side, I'm also trying to turn the photojournal into a video, which hopefully I will be able to share soon :)
